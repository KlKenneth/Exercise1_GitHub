Let it never be said
The romance is dead
'Cause there's so little else
Occupying my head
There is nothing I need
Except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed
Doesn't matter to me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby! [AhaAhaAaa]
And do you, do you, do you, do you? [AhaAhaAaa]
Know what you're doing doing to me? [AhaAhaAaa]
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby! [AhaAhaAaa]

Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is cancelled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby! [AhaAhaAaa]
And do you, do you, do you, do you? [AhaAhaAaa]
Know what you're doing doing to me? [AhaAhaAaa]
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby! [AhaAhaAaaAh]

Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me
And you don't really see
You with me?
Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me
And you don't really see
You with me?

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby! [AhaAhaAaa]
And do you, do you, do you, do you? [AhaAhaAaa]
Know what you're doing doing to me? [AhaAhaAaa]
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby! [AhaAhaAaa]
And do you, do you, do you, do you? [AhaAhaAaa.]
[Da da daa, da da daa.]
Know what you're doing doing to me? [AhaAhaAaaAhAa.]
[Da da daa.]
